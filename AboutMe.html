		<p> 	My name is Kelsey Griffin. I'm 16 and I'm a Junior in High School. I like to swim and play volleyball. 
				I also like to sing and my biggest goal is to become a model. I am going to start a diesel engineering program at my local college, so that when I finish High School I will be certified in it.</p>
			</br>

			<p> I like to take pictures for fun.</p>
