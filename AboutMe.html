		<p> 	My name is Kelsey Griffin. I'm 16 and I'm a Junior in High School. I like to swim and play volleyball. I have been a Girl Scout of San Gorgonio Council for 8 years.
				I also like to sing and my biggest goal is to become a model. I am going to start a diesel engineering program at my local college, so that when I finish High School I will be certified in it.</p>
